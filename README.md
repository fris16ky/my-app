# To-Do List App
Welcome to my Mobile Application! 
This program was made with only Android platforms in mind, I was not able to test it under iOS control. 
Additionally, towards the end of my development, I noticed that I was receiving errors on Android Studio. It turns out, CheckBox was removed from react-native, meaning my imports were all screwed up, and my final screen (the one where you add the reminder to the Home Screen) no longer works. 
It is still in this state, as I am in a bind with my Final Exams bearing down on me. 
#Advise
So, I advise that you run this program through yarn/npm web, as it is fully functional there. 
#Application Purposes
The reason I made this mobile app coincides with my previous HTML website. This was the Phase 2 for my CSI 3150: Web and Mobile Systems class, where we were tasked with creating a Mobile Application using React-Native and/or Expo. For Phase 1, I created a website that works akin to an agenda, keeping track of reminders the user can set on a day-to-day basis, with three working months. I followed the same theme with this application, where you can set reminders without the time aspect. This app is very simple in manner and design, but it is functional. 
#Credits
The idea for this application came from my ow thoughts, but I utilized some sources along the way. 
I followed a tutorial from https://www.simplilearn.com/react-native-tutorial-article, and made some stylistic adjustments along the way. All credit goes to Chinmayee Deshpande, and I appreciate their guide. 
For the text on the checkmark image upon completion/deletion of all reminders, I utilized https://www.fontspace.com/ananda-black-font-f85089's font on the image, with https://www.fontspace.com/sunny-spells-font-f68393 for the exclamation mark.
